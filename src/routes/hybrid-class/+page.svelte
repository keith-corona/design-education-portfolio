        Some people consider the hybrid format of courses to be the best of both
        worlds - online and in person - but there are some major considerations
        to contemplate in the planning of one of these courses. This hybrid
        course sample was designed for a 50/50 hybrid schedule; that is, for
        each in-person meeting there was to be planned an equal amount of
        asynchronous content.

        Consider In-Person Interaction
      </h2>
      <p class="text-lg">
        Compared with fully online or fully in-person courses, developing a
        hybrid course can prove to be extra challenging; the mixed modes of
        teaching add a layer of complication. This added layer, when planned
        well, can prove to be quite beneficial, nevertheless.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg">
        This hybrid course sample was a writing course, so there needed to be
        interaction in the preliminary stages of the writing process
        (brainstorming, structuring ideas, discussing different paths), while
        the later stages where the writing actually happened would benefit more
        from individual work.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg">
        How do you accomplish this when the writing process tends to be linear?
        One method is implementing the <a
          class="text-cyan-600 focus:text-amber-600 underline hover:text-cyan-800"
          href="https://bokcenter.harvard.edu/flipped-classrooms"
          target="_blank">flipped classroom</a
        >, and this method, to an extent, was used in this hybrid course.
        Students would access instructional materials in the online portion of
        the course while completing specific tasks during class time.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg">
        In this class, collaboration was emphasized by assigning a significant
        amount of small-group work to take advantage of the in-person meeting
        time.

        Don't Overload Students
      </h2>
      <p class="text-lg">
        Although wanting to take full advantage of meeting in person by packing
        the class time with activity upon activity like a conference, students
        can become overwhelmed. It’s important to structure an in person session
        in a hybrid course similar to structuring a traditional in-person
        course.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg">
        You should begin with some kind of ice breaker and/or warm-up exercise,
        have a clear itinerary presented to the students, and allow enough time
        for each activity. While the aim is no longer set on explaining big
        topics or ideas, there should be an emphasis on eliciting student
        questions primarily through task-based or collaborative activities.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg">
        Through the completion of this work, students should encounter a
        question they might not have been aware they had prior to beginning the
        activity.

        Embrace Spontaneity
      </h2>
      <p class="text-lg">
        In this hybrid writing course, students were tasked with brainstorming
        ideas related to an essay prompt in small groups during the in-person
        meeting. The essay prompt had been made available to them in the
        asynchronous portion of the course, and they were to read it and note
        any questions.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg">
        As it often is, there were no questions which sends the teacher the
        message that the material is completely understood, yet when
        collaborating to create a brainstorm, it came to be that students had
        different interpretations of what the prompt was asking for. In their
        small groups, this led to conversation, disagreement, and ultimately, a
        class discussion about the essay prompt.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg">
        The beauty of the hybrid model is that it supports spontaneity. Students
        can ask a question that can lead to a loosely related discussion. This
        is, more often than not, something that cannot be foreseen by the course
        designer (be it the actual course teacher or an instructional designer),
        and thus is not possible to incorporate in an asynchronous online
        course.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg">
        Despite this spontaneity being a positive feature of the hybrid model,
        it’s important to not allow these moments to take over the entire
        meeting. The topics brought to light can lead to follow-up readings or
        lessons for the asynchronous part of the course, so leave some room for
        flexibility in the course plan.
